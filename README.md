For RECOMB: The relevant files are model/models.py and model/custom_dataset, which contain the classes and methods used to train the binary (model_naiveBinary.py) and SoMatt (model_assays.py). For generating mutated and reference amino acid embeddings, the relevant file is embedding_model/qLoraEsm2/canonical_average_embeddings.py and canonical_ref_embeddings.py. Mutated sequences were generated by data_processing/mutated_sequence_generator.py.
